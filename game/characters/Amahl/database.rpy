        "The Shadow King. When I first met him, it was during my travels in Egypt as a younger man. I had heard rumors of a 'magician' who could make people see what he wanted them to and make them perform his bidding. He wasn't the first person I had heard of with so-called 'psychic powers', but on the off-chance he may be the genuine article, I made a point of seeking him out. He was leading a near-cult, of sorts, appearing as a self-styled 'Grand Priest' of crime. As we talked I <REDACTED> uncovering who - or what - he really was. What I discovered shocked me as <REDACTED> dueling on the psychic plane, leading to a near-fatal confrontation. One that only I walked away from.\n\nI thought that to be the end of it. I was wrong. Some time later, I encountered an individual who claimed to be the King himself, only this time, in the form of <REDACTED>. He - or should I say, she - had knowledge that only one who had been present at our battle would know and, more than that, possessed knowledge that only he or I would know. The idea that the man I thought dead could reappear and threaten me again disturbs me. The fact that he is somehow also capable of <REDACTED> terrifies me. He was dangerous when he 'merely' possessed limitless psychic power. Now. . . now I don't know how we could possibly stop him."]
