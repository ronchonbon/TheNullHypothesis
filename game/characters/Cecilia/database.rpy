        "While our medical bay is generously equipped with machines and technology that would make it the envy of any hospital in the world, there have been and will be times when we require more specialist, hands-on care. To that end, Cecilia has agreed to work with us as a medic on an ad-hoc basis. Her only request was that we keep her status as a mutant under wraps and use our resources to make sure it stays that way. As Cecilia works in a very prestigious hospital, and with anti-mutant hysteria at an all-time high, we will, of course, be respecting her wishes, as well as paying her a very generous monthly stipend to keep her on standby.\n\nCecilia is capable of generating a forcefield around her body, allowing her to protect herself and others from harm. She is also capable of forming simple weapons with the field, such as clubs and spikes. While the field renders her virtually immune from harm, severe impacts to it can cause pain to her. As such, she has shown a reluctance to use her ability, above and beyond wanting to keep her identity a secret."]
