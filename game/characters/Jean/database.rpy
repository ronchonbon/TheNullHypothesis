        "Jean was one of my first students and one of whom I am very proud. She came to us when she was eleven and, alongside Scott, has been instrumental in setting up everything we have done here. While once one of my leading students, Jean has decided to take a backseat role in things of late. I understand she has been going through some personal struggles which have affected her greatly and, as such, she will not be leading any missions or training if it can be avoided, though she will still take part on any missions as needed. This will be reviewed on an ongoing basis.",
        "Jean's mutant ability gives her psychic abilities similar to my own. As yet, she has not reached the heights I believe her to one day be capable of. Jean also has the ability of telekinesis. She is currently able to move objects in excess of five tons, though doing so takes a great strain on her mind. She is also capable of moving multiple objects at once over a large distance, though the more items she controls, the less precision she has. Her current record is 37 at once and, with training, I believe she may easily surpass that. She is also capable of flight, lifting herself and up to two others, moving at speeds of up to 40mph, though, again, the more she moves and the further she travels, the less control she has.",
        "NOTE: Jean has recently suffered some psychic trauma, leading to a loss of control with her telekinesis. It is my recommendation that she refrain from exerting herself in training or in missions, unless *extremely necessary*, due to the potential for harm, both to herself and others. This situation is being closely monitored, with checkups several times a week and full safety protocols in the Danger Room active whenever she is training."]

        "Mutiefan Entry for JEAN GREY\n\nThe heart and soul of her team, Jean tends to her friends with almost motherly devotion. Always the first to open a dialogue, Jean displays a saintly level of compassion and understanding, even towards her foes. She sees her reluctance to fight as a strength, believing that a strong connection to the hearts of her foes is the real way to mutant/human relations and that there will come a day when a true, lasting peace can be enjoyed by all."]
