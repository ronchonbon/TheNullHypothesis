        "For someone who has been tormented his entire life based purely on his appearance, Kurt has a remarkable perspective on life. I doubt there are many who could blame him if he decided to repay the world in kind. But, even at his young age, Kurt has the strength of character and heart to still reach out to people. Indeed, Kurt has made a wide network of friends in the school, to the point where he's jokingly referred to as the school 'welcoming committee.'",
        "This may be, at least in part, due to his upbringing, being raised as part of a traveling circus in his native Germany. There, he performed as one of the acrobats, where his appearance was believed to be makeup. The other performers, many of them outcasts in their own way, accepted him without question. Unfortunately, Kurt was caught up in a bout of anti-mutant hysteria and was nearly killed by a literal 'angry mob.' I had already dispatched my students on a recruitment mission to find him, which unfortunately turned into a rescue mission, but Kurt, understanding immediately what our greater mission is, pledged himself to our cause, seeing it as a way to pass on the kindness we showed him in his hour of need.",
        "Kurt's main power is the ability to teleport or, as he calls it, 'bamfing', due to the sound produced when he uses it. His ability also produces a cloud of purple smoke, which dissipates quickly, along with a lingering smell of sulfur. He is currently limited to distances of around 50 meters and while he can teleport through walls, he either has to have line of sight (i.e. through a window or security camera) or be familiar with the area he is moving to. This limits his effectiveness on infiltration missions, and the smell of sulfur unfortunately makes him easy to track."]
