        "Cain Marko is a former small-time criminal who received his powers from <REDACTED>. As his abilites come from an outside source, it is important to remember that he himself *is not a mutant*. Therefore, any weapons, technology or powers specifically targeting the X-gene will be ineffective. As an example, Rogue's ability seems to have limited effect on him, rendering her unconscious when she has tried to use them and leaving Marko angry, more than anything. So far, the only ways we have been able to stop him have been immobilization (using Jean's telekinesis to hold him in mid-air, as an example) or shutting him down psychically after removing his helmet. Any other methods have proved temporary at best, ineffective at worst.\n\nI just wish I could get to the truth of why my brother hates me so much."]
